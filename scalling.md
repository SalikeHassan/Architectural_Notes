Regarding Netflix, they use a technique called "Asynchronous Multi-Data Center Replication" to keep data synchronized across different data centers. This technique ensures that data changes made in one data center are propagated to others asynchronously, allowing for eventual consistency. This means that while data might not be immediately consistent across all data centers, it will eventually become consistent.

To manage this, Netflix uses their own custom replication technology, ensuring high availability and reliability. By replicating data across multiple data centers, they can provide users with a seamless experience even if one data center goes down.
